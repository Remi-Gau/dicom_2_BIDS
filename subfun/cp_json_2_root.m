function cp_json_2_root(src_file, opt)
    %  makes a copy of a json file from a subject folder to the base folder of the
    % BIDS data set by simply removing the sub-XXX prefix. Might still need some tweaking
    % and cleaning but it can be useful especially if the delete_json option has been
    % ticked

    [~, filename, ext] = spm_fileparts(src_file);
    [parts] = strsplit(filename, '_');
    parts(1) = []; % remove subject info
    tgt_file = join(parts, '_');
    tgt_file = fullfile(opt.tgt_dir, ...
                        [tgt_file{1} ext]);

    copyfile(src_file, tgt_file);
